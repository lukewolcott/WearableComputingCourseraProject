This is a repo for the course project in the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course from Johns Hopkins, via Coursera.  

The script run_analysis.R cleans up some data, summarizes it, and outputs a tidy data set.

The file CodeBook.md describes a little the data, the variables, and the transformations performed on the data to summarize and tidy it.
